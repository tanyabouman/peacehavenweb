Supporting individuals with disabilities and their families</h3>
<!--
<p>With thankfulness to the Lord, Peace Haven Free Reformed Association announces the opening of its second home for residential care. Peace Haven was organized by deacon representatives of Brantford, Dundas, Fenwick, Hamilton, St. George, St. Thomas and several elected members to support families who are caring for family members with disabilities.


<p>Six members of Free Reformed congregations are cared for by trained staff who help them develop programs to enrich their lives and support them to function to their fullest potential.

Peace Haven was organized by deacon representatives of Brantford, Dundas, Fenwick, Hamilton, St. George, St. Thomas and several elected members to support families who are caring for family members with disabilities.
</p>

<p>
Several members of Free Reformed congregations live in two Peace Haven homes and are cared for by trained staff who help them develop programs to enrich their lives and support them to function to their fullest potential. 
</p>

<p>
The Board thanks the churches, individuals and many volunteers who donated funds, material and labour for renovations, furniture, appliances, household items and groceries,&mdash;too many things to mention. The young people and the families who continue to offer friendship and respite care are also a real blessing.</p>

<p>The local deacons of each representative congregation will gladly give you information on how you can be involved and regularly support Peace Haven with operating costs. You can also directly contact our Treasurer.</p>
