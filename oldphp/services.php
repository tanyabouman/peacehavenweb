<h1>Long Term Assistance: Group Home/Foster Care </h1>
<p>The goal is to provide facilities where individuals with disabilities who can no longer live with their families can live in a Christian environment that is similar to that of their parental home. The aim is to have a place that will be close enough for regular family visits and attendance at a church that nurtures the individuals with disabilities in the faith of the parental home and church.</p>

<h1>Day Program</h1>
<!--
<p>In 2014, the board felt the need to add a day program.  This would enable those living at Peace Haven and others in the community to learn skills needed for everyday living.  A Director for the day program was hired and a suitable location is currently being sought out.
 </p>
-->
<p>
"The Farm" is a youth and adult Christian centre where persons with disabilities can enjoy meaningful day programs which will utilize their abilities and provide inclusive opportunities to grow and develop as individuals.  The Farm was opened in 2016 in a rural area near Brantford and Hamilton.  The Farm building includes a large room with kitchen and other areas for activities and socializing.  A workshop offers space for hands-on learning, such as woodworking, furniture building/refurnishing, engine/mechanical repairs, train and model car designing.  The barn and chicken coop allow opportunities to interact with and care for animals.  Outdoors, there is plenty of room for gardening, hiking, biking and other outdoor activities.
